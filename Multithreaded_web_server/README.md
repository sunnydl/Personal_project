## Multithreaded Web Server

### Introduction
In this project I am building a program that simulates the behavior of a basic http web server with multithreading functionality and logging ability, the server can process requests such as GET, PUT, and HEAD from different connections all at once, and is able to log the requests as it completes them so that the user can check and verify later on. The default thread usage is 4.

### Technologies I used
* C for the language
* Dynamic Queue for the Data Structure
* Pthread library for Multithreading
* Mutex locks and Conditional Variables for mutual exclusion
* Socket programming
* Getopt for arguments parsing

### Basic Instruction
##### Open a terminal and go to the directory where you place all the files for this project
##### Then enter the following in the terminal
```bash
make
./httpserver 8080 -N 3 -l logfile.txt
```
##### After that, a file named "logfile.txt" will be made for the server to log the requests, the server port will be set to 8080 with a thread usage of 3.
#####
##### To send requests to the server, open another terminal, use curl commands such as the following example:
##### curl -T input http://localhost:8080/0123456789abcde -v
###### ---This will generate a PUT request to destination file "0123456789abcde" using the contents of the file "input"
##### curl http://localhost:8080/0123456789abcde -v -o output
###### ---This will generate a GET request to destination file "0123456789abcde" and store the content to file "output"
##### curl -T input http://localhost:8080/0123456789abcde -v
###### ---This will generate a HEAD request to destination file "0123456789abcde" and get back the file size
#####
##### To send multiple requests from different connections, use a test.sh script with content such as following:
###### curl localhost:8080/test0file012345 &
###### curl localhost:8080/0123456789abdec \
######     localhost:8080/abc123456789abc -I &
###### curl localhost:8080/1234 &
###### curl 127.0.0.1:8080/abcdde012345678 -T test.sh &
##### And enter the following in terminal
```bash
bash test.sh
```
#####
##### After done with the program, use control c to terminate the program.
